st.write("### What is it? : ")
st.write("Anomaly detection in time series entails identifying significant deviations from expected patterns within recorded sequential observations over time. The goal is to highlight instances where behavior diverges from the norms,  which helps in recognizing unusual events.")

st.write("### Why anomaly detection ?: ")
st.write("Anomaly detection is a critical step that need to be established in order to ensure the safety and the security of a given system . The sudden occurrence of an huge change in the pattern might be an indication of an error in the system or a a hacking attempt or any other unexpected events.")
